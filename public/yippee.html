        <tiny-text>Dear, James <br>
            I know it's ugly, but I tried my best. If I was a teenager in the Y2K era I'd be a myspace
            warrior. But unfortunately, I'm not. So I had to look up so many tutorials and shamelessly use ChatGPT.
            My heart hurts just thinking about it. But I must move on, as now I have a cute little webpage :3 <br>
            <br>
            I didn't use it for this little paragraph though. I'm not crazy. Anyhow, hurray! You're my boyfriend now!
            I'm your girlfriend! Crazy! Though this webpage is only three buttons big, I made those three buttons out of blood, sweat and tears.
            Mostly tears. I do plan on makinh more of these, or at the least sell the code so other people can ask out their special person.
            But I'm rambling too much. I want to talk about you. Or us, I suppose.<br>
            <br>
            Clearly, you picked yes, meaning we are officaly an item! Hurray! You can actually say it! Sorry for making you wait so long. I would say 
            I'm sorry but it was fun watching squirm. Not that I hate you and want to see you hurting 
            but rather in a fun and teasing way. I do like you, after all. Quite a bit.<br>
            <br>
            I never thought I'd find myself in a relationship, especially one that ended up being so fun and warm.
            But now that I have you I wonder how I managed to go without. Too cheesy? Whatever. I just think you're neat.
            You make me laugh and smile and when I get a notification on my phone I always hope it's you. I just hope you feel the same.
            I mean, I'd think so, we are together now. If you didn't like me why waste the time?<br>
            <br>
            As you know, I'm not the most affectionate or lovey dovey person ever, but that doesn't mean I don't like you and dream of experiencing
            high school together. I just so happen to find my love more so situated in my fingertips than my heart. I like writing and drawing
            and expressing myself in ways my mouth can't even begin to articulate. So if I ignore you or jump or grimace at you, it's not you. 
            Far from it. You're unfortunately one of my favorite people so that means you're stuck with me for quite a while. This also means instead 
            of hugs or cuddles or kisses or whatever, you'll just get a long winded essay about how cool I think you are.<br>
            <br>
            Sorry.<br>
            <br>
            I really am excited to be your girlfriend. Like, more excited than even I thought I'd be. And I like you, a lot. So, yeah. <br>
            <br>
